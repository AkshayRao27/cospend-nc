# Nextcloud Cospend

Nextcloud Cospend is a group/shared budget manager.
It was inspired by the great [IHateMoney](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/).

You can use it when you share a house, when you go in vacation with friends, whenever you share money with others.

It lets you create projects with members and bills. Each member has a balance computed from the project bills.
This way you can see who owes the group and who the group owes. Ultimately you can ask for a settlement plan telling you which payments to make to reset the projet balances.

Project members are independent from Nextcloud users.
Once you've got access to a project (as a guest or as a Nextcloud user), there is no restriction on what you can add/edit/delete.
Projects can be accessed and modified by people without a Nextcloud account. Each project has an ID and a password for guest access.

[MoneyBuster](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/moneybuster) Android client is available (soon on F-Droid).
